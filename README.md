Big Boy Toyz is also known as BBT was founded in the year 2009 by Jatin Ahuja. The main goal was to transform and make the previously owned exotic car business big in a country like India. One can find cars like BMW, Audi, Range Rover, Aston Martins, Bentley, Lamborghini, and others parked in their showrooms.

Redesigning the website in an attractive approach was quite a challenge. After a thorough UX Study, we acknowledged there were certain loopholes in the applications that were kept untouched during its development. Check out the attached design file in this repo itself.
